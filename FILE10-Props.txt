REACT PROPS
	1) Props in React:
		-> Props (Short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to child component in React.
	
	2) Data Flow:
		-> Props enable a unidirectional data flow, where data is passed from parent to child but not the other way around.

	3) Immutable and Ready-Only:
		-> Props are immutable and can't br modified by the child component that receives them.

	4) Passing Props:
		-> Parent components pass props to child components by including them as attributes in the child components JSX element.

	Note :
		-> Props only get sent from Parent to Child
		-> Child Component can't modify/change the props
		-> You can see any number of props
		-> They can have name and value
		-> It can be optional too.
