FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS
    1) Defination:
        -> Functional components are javascript function that return JSX(UI Elements).
        -> Regular javascript functions.
        -> The function will return the JSX.

    2) Syntax:
        -> They are writing as regular Javascript function, ofthen using arrow function syntax.

    3) Stateless:
        ->Functional copmpnents are stateless by default, meaning they dont have their own internal state.
        -> They reiy on props passed from appart.

    Note : A stenless copmpnents, also known as a funcional components, is a fundamental concept in react that represents a UI element without any internal state management.

    4) State management:
        -> state management in react application that enable you to modularize and that will encapsulate the updates of states.
        -> Therefoure you can maintain and debug your codebase.
        ->proir to react 16.8, funcional component could't manage state.
        -> with introduction to Hooks, they can now manage state using the 'useState' hook.

    5) Lifecycle:

        -> Functional component don't have lifestyle method like class component.
        -> Instead, they can use Hooks like "useEffect" to replicate lifestyle behavior.

    6) Performance:

        -> functional component are generally considered more lightweight and easier to optimize, as they don't involved the overhead of class component instances.

    7) Readability:

        -> Functional component can be more concise and easier to read, especially for simpler UI render

    8) Code Organization:

        -> Functional component promote functional programing concept and modular code Organization.
