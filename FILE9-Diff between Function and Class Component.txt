DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FUNCTION AND CLASS COMPONENTS
	
	1) Function Components
		-> Defined as Javascript functions.
		-> Introduced with React Hooks.
		-> Syntax : Arrow or regular function.
		-> State managed using useState and Hooks.
		-> No lifecycle methods; replaced by Hooks lihe useEffect.
		-> Generally lighter weight for better performance.
		-> Context accessed using useContext Hook.
		-> Encourages reusability and modularity.
		-> Typically easier to read and understand.


	2) Class Components
		-> Defined as ES6 classes extends React.Component.
		-> Traditional React components.
		-> Syntax: Class with lifecycle methods.
		-> State managed using this.state and this.setState.
		-> Utilizes lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and ect.
		-> Slightly heavier in terms of performance optimization.
		-> Context accessed using this.context.
		-> Traditional approach for complex components.
		-> More verbose and can be harder to read.
