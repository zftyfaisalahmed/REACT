FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS
	1) Definition:
		-> Class components are ES6 classes that extend 'React.component' and define the 'render' method to return JSX.

	2) Syntax:
		-> They use the class syntax introduced in ES6, with methods like 'render', 'componentDidMount', etc.

	3) State Management:
		-> Class components have their own internal state managed using the 'setState' method.

	4) Lifecycle:
		-> Class component can use lifecycle methods like 'componentDidMount', 'componentDidUpdate' and 'componentWillUpdate' for managing side effects.

	5) Stateless/Stateful:
		-> Class components can be stateless or stateful (When they manage their own state)

	6) Performance:
		-> Class components can have more overhead in terms of performance, especially when dealing with unnecessary re-renders.

	7) Complexity:
		-> For more complex components with state management and lifecycle needs, class components might be a better fit.
